Name: Krishna Idnani
Module Chosen: Dynamic Programming
learned how to solve complex problems efficiently by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid repeated work. I
understood the concept of optimal substructure and when a problem can be solved using dynamic programming. I also learned both memoization (top down) and tabulation (bottom up) approaches. 
Overall, this module improved my ability to design optimized solutions and reduce time complexity.
